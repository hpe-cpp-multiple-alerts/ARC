# Root Cause Detector

## What is this application?

The Root Cause Detector is an intelligent application designed to automatically detect and identify the root cause of multiple alerts that are raised simultaneously by a single fault in a microservices environment.

**Key Features:**

- Real-time alert monitoring and analysis
- Causal inference using historical alert data
- Probability-based root cause detection
- WebSocket-based real-time notifications
- HTTP listener for alert ingestion
- Service dependency graph analysis

This tool is particularly useful for DevOps teams and SREs who need to quickly identify the source of cascading failures in complex microservices architectures.

## Prerequisites

### Python Installation

This application requires Python 3.8 or higher. Please install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your system's package manager.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd root-cause-detector
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The application requires the following key dependencies:

- `aiohttp` - Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework
- `PyYAML` - YAML parser and emitter
- `asyncio` - Asynchronous I/O support
- Additional supporting libraries for networking and data processing

## Running the Application

### Start the Root Cause Detector

```bash
python -m src.main
```

The application will:

1. Load the service dependency graph from `test_data/test_service_map.yaml`
2. Preprocess historical alert data from `test_data/data/` to compute causal relationships
3. Start the HTTP listener for receiving new alerts
4. Initialize the probability-based detector
5. Begin monitoring for real-time alerts

### Application Components

- **HTTP Listener**: Receives alerts via HTTP endpoints
- **Probability Detector**: Analyzes alerts using causal inference
- **Service Graph**: Maps service dependencies and relationships
- **WebSocket Notifier**: Provides real-time notifications
- **Alert Storage**: Maintains alert history and state

### Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the application.

## Configuration

The application uses configuration files located in the project root:

- `config.yaml` - Main application configuration
- `service_dependancy_map.yaml` - Service dependency mappings
- `test_data/` - Test data and historical alerts

## Development

For development and testing, the application includes:

- Test data in the `test_data/` directory
- Historical alerts in `test_data/data/` (generated by `generate.py`)
- Comprehensive test suite in the `tests/` directory

### Generating Test Data

To generate synthetic alert data for testing:

```bash
python generate.py
```

This will create realistic alert scenarios in the `test_data/data/` directory that can be used to test the root cause detection algorithms.

## TODO

- [x] Complete skeleton
- [x] Make prototype compatible with alerts types given by alertmanager
- [x] Test with the example application -> example deployment
